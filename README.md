# AI_intelligentAgent
<p>The purpose of this project is to build an intelligent agent that can navigate through a grid world to reach a reward using reinforcement learning. This problem is useful for more applicable real-world situations such as robotics, drones, video games, self-driving vehicles, healthcare, and marketing where an agent must make independent decisions to reach desired goals. 
This problem was solved with a Q-learning agent which is an active learning technique that operates with no model that seeks to find the best action to take given its current operating state. Q-learning was found to have strong results similar to the value iteration results as they increased and decreased together. It is recommended that Q-learning be used for this problem as it is an unknown environment with no known policy and Q-learning can excel in this environment even without prior knowledge. </p>
